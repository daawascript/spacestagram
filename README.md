**An app for shopify winter 2022 front-end internship.**

## Intro

We are expanding Shopify's business to the universe and fetching photos from outer space thanks to NASA's amazing Astronomy Picture Of the Day API. The app initially loads 10 random pictures and is infinitely scrollable with 10 more random pictures every time you reach the bottom of the page.

## Technologies & choices

This project is built with React and Styled-Components. Shopify's own eslint plugin was used in order to get used to the company's coding style.

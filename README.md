# Spacestagram

**An app for shopify winter 2022 front-end internship.**

## Intro

We are expanding Shopify's business to the universe and fetching photos from outer space thanks to NASA's amazing Astronomy Picture Of the Day API. The app initially loads 10 random pictures and is infinitely scrollable with 10 more random pictures every time you reach the bottom of the page.  
The live version of this app can be found at https://spacestagram.theoleveque.com.

## Technologies & choices

This project is built with React and Styled-Components. Shopify's own eslint plugin was used in order to get used to the company's coding style.

## Accessibility

I also used the a11y eslint plugin to make sure that the app stayed accessible throught development. Lighthouse reports were also ran to make sure that nothing was left behind.

### Special Thanks

1. Instagram for their simplistic yet elegant design as well as some of their svg icons,
2. NASA for their great API,
3. IconMonstr for the other svg icons
4. Shopify for the opportunity to unleash my creativity on an interesting idea of theirs
